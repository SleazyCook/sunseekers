        Safzira and Elizana go to the Swift Finish to wash up and unwind<br />
        Saf sends a message by carrier pigeon to young priest<br />
        The party is followed by a mysterious stranger, Elizana realizes he works for the Wachter family and agrees to arrange a meeting at dinner that same day<br />

        PCs meet Kasimir and the rest of the Dusk elves outside of the camp<br />

        Upon reaching the Vistani camp at the top of the hill, they meet Luvash whipping teenage Alexi for falling asleep and losing his 7yr old daughter Arabelle. Arrigal offers silver for her safe return.<br />
        Elizana, Ireena, and Vasili meet with Lady Fiona Wachter over a formal dinner to discuss the possibility of a coup in her favor. She says her henchman Ernst can assist with tracking Izek so the party can dispose of him and her influence and wealth should take care of the rest. If they are successful in assisting her she will pay out more than the full worth of Elizana's ring. <br />
        Saf, German, and Kasimir use a found Blinsky doll to track down Bluto, the town drunk, who might have kidnapped Arabelle, the missing Vistana girl.<br />
        Saf and Kasimir use a boat to slowly row within 100 feet of the mysterious boat to use her owl familiar<br />

        Saf jumps in and rescues the child, leaving Bluto behind.<br />

        Millovaj is catatonic and new kid Felix seems to be carving demonic glyphs over kids beds. A shadow demon appears when Felix is confronted and makes a deal with German in abyssal. The demon drops the kid and hides in a locket given to German.
