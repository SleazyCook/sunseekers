        Dearest Father, <br /><br />
        It’s happened. By the grace of the gods, I have managed to convince Gideon to send me on my first quest all on my own. Well, that is not entirely true, I have FreeBird with me. I have made much progress with our magical lessons, he is the only one I can trust with my secrets and my very life. I am awaiting the man I am meant to trail, Viktor Lazlo. He has taken something from the Golden Circle, some text that they are desperate to recover, desperate enough to send me. I must retrieve it at all costs. I hope that my success will bring me closer to uncovering the truth behind your disappearance. I despise the gods, mothers incessant ramblings about how we must praise them still rings in my mind, but I will pray that they can bring me closer to you and that by some miracle you are still alive somewhere…<br /><br />

        I write to you from The Sunset, Viktor Lazlo’s traveling show. I have told him that I am an escape artist. He brought me aboard easily enough, he didn’t even ask me to prove my skill. I do not know if this is a good omen or a bad one. Others have joined us, we travel with a halfling of golden hair named Elizana and a large barbarian who smells of wet dog named German. I am wary of German. He reminds me of the men they hire to dispose of traitors in the Golden Circle. I hope to avoid him or at the very least gain his favor. He may be useful in a fight if it comes to that. I have grown weary of this jilting carriage even though I have only been aboard a few hours. Viktor Lazlo has informed us that we should be arriving at our destination in a few days. I must find a way to search his wagon without arousing suspicion, this may prove difficult as Elizana has taken a liking to me and Free Bird and spends most of her time making conversation with me.<br /><br />

        As usual my prayers have fallen on deaf ears. Not even the gods can help me now. Viktor Lazlo is dead. German beheaded him before us all. I do not know how I can proceed from here. Two days ago we happened across some children on the side of the road. They asked us to help their infant brother who was trapped in their home. I did not want to help, I felt something was wrong down to the very core of my being the instant the Sunset crossed into the borders of Barovia. Elizana, Viktor and German left me with the children to go investigate their home. Being in the presence of the children gave me goose flesh and I could not stand to be with them alone so I reluctantly joined the others. The house exuded evil, macabre images were plastered on all the elegant wallpapers and wooden carvings throughout the manor. Many strange occurrences that I cannot explain and wish to put out of my mind. The home was haunted by the souls of the children we met on the road. We found many writings detailing this family's fall from grace. They seem to have been involved with cultists. We found the children's bones in the attic of the home. I do not want to imagine the suffering they must have endured slowly starving to death. Our discovery of their infant brother was even more gruesome. His corpse was attached to a grotesque creature, a flesh mound of sorts. Never in my life have I witnessed such horrors. The creature asked for an offering which we refused. Viktor Lazlo however had other plans. He wanted to sacrifice a poor starving dog we found in one of the rooms in the manor. That is when German snapped. He cut through Viktor Lazlo's neck as though it was nothing. I cannot get this image out of my mind. His head rolling the disgusting thump of his head and body will haunt me forever. We were able to defeat this creature and we laid the children's bones to rest. At the very least they can finally be at peace. When we finally left that hellish manor there was a basket awaiting us with a note welcoming us to Barovia. I do not know how Elizana could happily consume its contents after all we have seen. I am shaken to my very core. What will I do now, father? How will I find this text when its thief has now departed this world? <br /><br />

        Dearest Father, <br /><br />
        The village of Barovia is bleak, but these little pleasures must be taken when they can. I am in much higher spirits this evening. Upon arriving at the village German and I sought out the tavern to help soothe our souls from travel and the horrors of the Durst Manor. All the tavern had to offer was wine but we were approached by a handsome man named Ismark. He asked us to help his sister. There have been strange attacks on this village which would certainly explain its dreadful appearance. It is clear to me that this village has seen better days. This country seems to be plagued by a great evil, capable of creating legions of the undead. I am not equipped for this type of setting but I must make do. I refuse to give up on my quest, I will do anything to find you, Father. Ismark and Ireenas father was the burgomaster of this village; they needed our help to transport his body to the church for a proper burial. Their grief was palpable. I can only pray that my own story will have a happy ending, that I will not have to grieve your loss before I’ve had a chance to meet you. Ismark and Ireena told us of the many troubles their village faces, including the fact that they have no clean water to consume. Upon inspecting the local well we found, much to our horror, that it was filled with the rotting corpses of the undead. How they got there I do not know. It was not easy to dispose of these creatures as their limbs continue to attack as they are being severed. The only thing that seems to stop them is destroying their heads. After our battle, Ismark was kind enough to offer us room and board in his manor. Ismark is a lovely man, I am not ashamed to admit that I sought his bed this evening. He sleeps peacefully now as I write to you. I look forward to our trip to Vallaki. It is said that Vallaki is the largest city in the country. I hope to find some of my guild members so that I can receive new orders. Not all is lost.<br /><br />

        Dearest Father, <br /><br />
        I fear for my safety and that of Free Bird in this strange country. Much has happened in the village of Barovia since I last wrote you. Elizana spoke to some villagers that claimed people were going missing under mysterious circumstances. A cloaked figure in the night was often seen lurking about the missing peoples homes the eve of their disappearances. This figure was often spotted walking in the direction of the village church, the Church of the Morning Lord. I tried to be impartial but I cannot trust those who lead others to believe in a “higher power”. Thankfully my suspicions were not unfounded. The priest, Father Donavich, was hiding a terrible secret. His son, Doru, is a vampire spawn. Father Donavich was hiding him in the basement of the church and feeding him the missing villagers! Yet another reason to distrust those who praise gods, their hypocrisy knows no end. Although it was clear that Doru could not be left alive I felt pity for him. He appeared to me as a poor cursed soul rather than an evil creature. I could see the tremendous effort he was making not to kill us. In the end it had to be done, though I took no pleasure in it. Father Donavich made a run for it but was quickly apprehended by myself and Elizana. Ismark had him sent to the local jailhouse; the village will now need a new priest. Ismark has asked us to recruit a new priest from Vallaki, a quest we were happy to accept. After last night there isn’t much Ismark could ask of me that I would not agree to. We embarked on our journey to Vallaki this afternoon. I was happy to get started on this journey and hopefully find a new direction to complete my quest and find this text. My happiness was short-lived. Strahd appeared before us in all of his terrible, yet extremely attractive, glory. He did not attempt to take Ireena, who is now traveling with us upon Ismark’s request. He merely delivered an ominous message. He seems to know all that we do and can materialize at any given moment. This strikes fear into my heart and I despise myself for feeling and attraction to him. After he relayed his message a strange mist enveloped us and we came to in the Tser Pool encampment. We were taken to Madame Eva’s tent where she gave us a strange reading. I must commit this information to memory. She was not at all like the supposed psychics that peddle lies in the city, there was a ring of truth to her words that will likely help us escape the evil of this land. I can only hope that Free Bird and I make it out of here alive. <br /><br />

        Dearest Father, <br /><br />
        I can confidently say that I enjoy the company of both Elizana and German. We have grown close these past days on this perilous road to Vallaki. Today is a bright spot in my memory. We came across a run down mill just outside of the city and decided to stop to investigate. We met a lovely young woman named Bella. She operates a bakery that sells a wonderful little pastry that she calls a Dream Pastry. Elizana and I were more than happy to partake. German however, being the sullen barbarian he often is, refused. To our surprise and utter enjoyment they contain hallucinogenic properties. I saw myself floating off into realms filled with beauty. I have never felt such joy or freedom in my waking life! Elizana and I purchased several pastries to take with us on the road. I eagerly look forward to consuming them again!  <br /><br />

        Dearest Father, <br /><br />
        We have finally arrived in Vallaki. We were told that this is the largest “city” that Barovia has to offer, although it is a far cry from the city I was living in before taking this quest, it looks enjoyable enough. Frankly I am happy to be out of the woods and to have access to a bathing house. I must admit that the city is a bit odd. The burgomaster has a set of bizarre laws in place that may prove difficult for our little party. I had to resist the urge to look at German when they stated that fighting was strictly forbidden. My instincts tell me to keep my head down but I don't know if it will be possible with these two. I wonder if this city is truly safe from Strahd, the burgomaster seems to think so. It is an enticing thought. It would be nice to have even a morsel of safety after all the things we have seen. We did find a strange little toy shop when we were shopping around. The owner seems frightened and is being forced to make these macabre dolls that resemble Ireena and Strahd. I was rather unsettled seeing these dolls, I cannot stop thinking about them. What could they mean? It seems the further we travel into Barovia the more questions I have about this country. I had hoped that I would find some kind of marking or clue to indicate that members of my guild have been through this city but I did not come across any, not even at the brothel. After all the members that have gone missing in search of this artifact I find it very odd. What happened to them? Were they unable to reach Vallaki? I will begin to leave my own markings to prove that I was once here. I hope that I do not vanish without a trace like the rest of them.  <b><u>Thieve's Cant: </u></b> /* We have managed to uncover the mysteries of one of Madame Tarrokas cards! We found the Entertaining man with a monkey. He is an older man and a half elf just like me. It felt wonderful to speak to someone in my native tongue. He has come into Barovia with an alias, he is actually a famed monster hunter seeking to destroy Strahd. We are lucky to have him by our side. This meeting has renewed my confidence, we may yet find a way to leave this wretched country! */<br /><br />

        Dearest Father,<br /><br />
        Much has changed in the course of eight days. That lovely young woman I wrote about a few days back turned out to be a witch in disguise. This coven was using the windmill (which by the way I hold the deed to, I need to find some way to use this deed to my advantage…) as a base of operations of sorts to make pies out of the bones of children!! My blood ran cold when I found out. Just hours before receiving this information I had delivered 12 children to them! We rushed over to the windmill after rescuing German, that is another long story for another time, to rescue the children. The witches were powerful enemies, luckily were able to get the children out of the windmill and Free Bird raced back to Vallaki with them aboard the wagon while we distracted the witches. I was certain we would be able to defeat them. Gideon has alway told me that my confidence surpasses my skill by miles, and he may be right. We foolishly followed them into the woods as they attempted to escape us and there they revealed their true power. We were swiftly overcome and then bewitched. Turned to rats and forced to deliver a message to Ravenloft of all places! We were weak from the battle but managed to rescue a poor old man from Strahd's dungeon. In our attempt to locate the exit, we found Strahd. He was a horribly beautiful sight to behold. His raven black hair cascaded down his back glistening in the candle light as he played a haunting melody on the organ. The old man began screeching at the sight of Strahd and was swiftly beheaded by those pale elegant hands. How can someone commit such atrocities and then carry on a civil conversation? Strahd baffles me. Every instinct in my body was roaring for me to get as far away as possible from him but I could not move a muscle. I was entranced by his very presence, his gaze holding me captive. I cannot even remember what German and I told Strahd, it is all a haze. Next thing I knew he had drawn us close with his cool hands around our necks. I can still feel the light prick of his nails on my neck. His lips were mere inches away, I could see the flash of his fangs as he propositioned German and I. German is far stronger than I and thankfully got us out of the situation. Strahd gave us directions out of his castle and continued playing his organ. I am ashamed of my feelings toward Strahd. He has shown me time and time again that he is irredeemable, but why do I feel drawn to him? <br /><br />

        Dearest Father, <br /><br />
        Growing up in Hansari surrounded by our people always made me feel suffocated. I felt that they expected me to think and act as they do but I still felt that I was “not one of the people” because I was something other, part human. All I wanted was a way out, a way to experience life and all its wonders. I wanted to meet all kinds of people and cultures and truly find my place in this world. I am not like those I grew up with, I will not live as long as they do. I never understood their contentment to live out the many many years they are gifted in complete isolation. I promised myself not to make that same mistake. I will use the time I am allotted to truly live. These past few years living in Falkirk with Freebird were everything I could have ever hoped for. Bustling city streets and people of all shapes and sizes living together in a city that felt alive in some way. Being away from all the distractions of the city, trapped in this dreadful country, has brought back those feelings of isolation. I have been thinking about Mother and Hansari so much as of late and just as these thoughts plagued my mind, I met Kasimir. I did not expect to meet another elf in Barovia, especially one that is so easy on the eyes. I must admit meeting Rictavio was a comfort that soothed my home sickness momentarily but Kasimir feels different. He welcomed us into his camp and told us of his people that are all but extinct due to Strahd. My heart aches for him and the horrors he witnessed. I feel this need to somehow comfort him and I don't know if it is due to his appearance or due to my loneliness. All I know for certain is that Kasimir feels  familiar somehow and it is wonderfully comforting. He graciously offered us a place to sleep in his camp as it grew too dark to trek back to Vallaki. We stayed up late conversing by the hearth of his cabin and eventually those words turned into kisses and caresses. I have taken many lovers since leaving my village, but that evening was different somehow, it felt important, meaningful. Kasimir has certainly made an impact on me. I'm going to wrap this up now, Freebird keeps trying to read over my shoulder, that gossip. <br /><br />

        Dearest Father, <br /><br />
        -Feast of St. Andral
        Vallaki is in ruins. The events of last night are still incomprehensible to me. Somehow we all deluded ourselves into thinking that we had this under control. That bad things seem to happen in this country but not to us, certainly nothing bad could happen to us. I feel as though I’ve finally woken up and seen the truth. I will die here if I don’t make a change. I feel silly for having thought that Freebird and I could take on this mission when so many had disappeared. I won't allow myself to dwell on the disappointment and self pity that threatens to consume me. I won’t think about the fact that the church suffered the most catastrophic blow and that Franz is likely dead. I must push on, I must find a way to survive this place. That is why I have decided to leave. I asked Freebird to join me but he has grown quite fond of Elizana and he worries about her safety in this place. I understand his sentiment but I cannot make anymore mistakes like this and put myself in jeopardy any longer. Strahd is ruthless, calculating and unpredictable. We are not equipped to face him, I hope to change that. Kasimir told us about a place with great power, capable of bringing back the dead. I hope that it may also offer a way to leave this horrible place for good or some power that can help me survive this ordeal. I feel very uncomfortable separating from Freebird but he has promised to be cautious and I know that I must trust him. I plan to disappear in the crowds today, I cannot face Elizana, I know she will be saddened to see me go. I can only hope that her and Freebird will be safe. I don’t know what I would do if something happened to them. <br /><br />
