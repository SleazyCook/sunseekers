        6th Evening of Hammer<br /><br />

        My father, Kolyan, has passed. My heart breaks now that I must say goodbye, that I will never again hear his kind words of encouragement or sneak into his office to aid him with his civic duties, but his love and admiration towards his family and his people already transcends his mortality. While I do not recall much of my six years before I was adopted, taking his name as my own has been the honor of a lifetime.. He and Ismark are all the family I’ve known and now we are all that remains of his legacy. I have seen my brother follow in his footsteps to rise up and take on the burdens of others, but Strahd has set his eyes on me just as my father feared. If I had listened to him, if I had been more cautious, he might still be alive today. I was far too determined to protect our village that I neglected to conceal myself from the watchful eye of Strahd. Now that he has set eyes on me he torments our entire village. I will not allow him to take everyone else down with me.. I will defend my home and my father’s legacy to my dying breath. So I write this diary so that no matter what happens to me, someone somewhere might still know that there was once a light in Barovia - and his name was Kolyan Indirovich.

        11th Night of Hammer<br /><br />

        Today we buried our father. So many souls continue to suffer in unrest since the torment began in our village. I wish we had the resources to safely bury all of our brothers and sisters properly, but I am grateful that we were at least able to bury one. It could not have happened without the help of the travelers that Ismark brought to the manor. They are not barovians or vistani, that much is plain to see. I have never met anyone quite like them. German, a large burly man with long hair and a wild look in his eyes. Elizana, an impossibly small woman with golden hair and a cheerful countenance. Safzira, a woman with pointed ears adorned with more gold jewelry than I have ever seen on one person. Free Bird is the strangest of all. He is a raven the size of a grown man with glossy feathers and is capable of fire magic. I could not help suspect that they were agents of Strahd when they first arrived but after all their help I can see that they have good hearts. They ended the plague! It was such a rush to clear the zombies out of the well, battling alongside German and Safzira as Elizana and Free Birds arrows and fire rained down from above. Ismark has asked these travelers to take me away with them and keep me safe. Although there is much work to be done in our village, I do believe that everyone will be safer when I go. While I do look forward to seeing the rest of Barovia for the first time, I only hope I do not bring the torment with me.

        15th Morning of Hammer<br /><br />

        It was difficult to say goodbye to Ismark the other day. A sudden thought that it could be the last time sprang forth in my mind and it frightens me. I know I must not think this way lest I unwittingly will it into existence. The road was quiet and companionable until the sun set. Strahd materialized before us and insisted I become his wife! I could not live with myself if I had to spend the rest of my days married to that deplorable man, if he can even be considered a man. Being in his presence makes my flesh crawl, it's as if my very soul rejects his abhorrent existence. An immense feeling of dread has consumed me, keeping me awake through the night.. Even as I write about him my hands begin to shake, my heart beat pounding in my ears. Will I ever be free?  It seems the travelers did not know what to make of him. They do not yet understand the vile things he is capable of.  They have shown fortitude and determination but can they stand a chance against the embodiment of absolute evil?  Madame Eva, a questionable Vistana, seems to believe they can defeat him. I’m not sure if it is possible to trust those who have been known to be loyal to Strahd. The Vistani who took over our once lovely Blood of the Vine tavern back home have been nothing but cruel to my people and they seem to look up to this fortune teller.

        18th Night of Hammer<br /><br />

        I believe I’ve just survived a spiritual encounter. A kind girl shared some freshly baked Dream Pastries with us and allowed us to make camp outside of her windmill home. These weren’t just any desserts though, Safzira and Elizana indulged with me and it was as if the Mists cleared and we were transported to the Ethereal Plane. I felt a deep sisterhood with these women. We shared laughs as we warmly rolled around with the adorably cute Lancelot calling out our shared and individual experiences through time and space. Although there was a point where I looked around and saw no one around me. I felt the cold air coming down from a mountain that wasn’t there. Fresh water drowned me as I could hear a child scream for help until it was silenced by snapping teeth. I descended through the dark lake into the halls of a church I have never seen. I felt connected to a god I’ve never worshiped. They say the souls of Barovians, trapped by the Mists, are reborn into our children. Were these someone else’s memories or my own? Are they memories at all or omens for what has yet to come?

        20th afternoon of Hammer<br /><br />

        Baron Vallakovich is no Kolyan and Vallaki is nothing like home. The Baron seems to have convinced his people that he can somehow keep Strahd at bay with these ridiculous festivals, while my home thrived in spite of the constant threat of Castle Ravenloft looming overhead . They are totally unaware of the outside world and I believe they will be left defenseless when the Devil comes to collect. The Baron has also imposed strict laws that restrict people’s basic speech and behavior, but the people of Vallaki are too blinded by frivolous material desires like clothing and jewelry to take a stand. The streets are littered with half-eaten food and junk; never could I have imagined so much wealth going to waste. Despite my concerns, I am taking one breath at a time and trying to take it all in.

        22nd evening of Hammer<br /><br />

        The silliest man I have ever met has attempted to court me. The scoundrel in question is the town accountant Vasili Von Holtz. He represents everything I despise about this town; while there are people starving back home, he casually eats ice cream. There are wolves ripping apart helpless travelers on the Old Svalich Road and he stops on the street to sing along to the Vallkian Bard’s song “All Will Be Well!’ What a ridiculous lie - all is certainly not well in Vallaki or otherwise. Vasili chuckles and claims he thinks the song is funny and ironic. There is something unique about him that I can’t quite put my finger on, so I might entertain his silly advances to pass the time. If I am being perfectly honest I could use the company while the Sunseekers are busy running all over town. I do love hearing about their little adventures from Elizana and Safzira at the Blue Water Inn the last couple of nights.

        27th afternoon of Hammer<br /><br />

        Free Bird has notified me that the Sunseekers have made a grizzly discovery at the windmill. That lovely girl I met days ago was part of a coven of witches using the windmill for nefarious purposes. Those dream pastries Safzira, Elizana and I willingly partook were made with nonother than the ground bones of children! Did this kind of evil exist without Strahd or does his existence beget it? Free Bird returned alone two days ago with a wagon full of orphans. I can only imagine the horrors these children must have witnessed but I am glad they may yet live full lives .I fear the worst as days go by with no word from German, Safzira and Elizana. What could have happened to them? Were they unable to defeat the witches? I know that Free Bird grows more perturbed as the days pass. He is keeping his mind occupied learning healing spells. Spending these days with him helps ease my nerves as well. Vasili has also been a great comfort, he periodically checks on me and offers words of consolation. I find myself looking forward to his visits and silly anecdotes. I know he must have much to do in the city and it means so much to me that he takes the time to seek me out. I enjoy our strolls in Vallaki and watching him interact with its denizens. He has taken me to a shop with the most delicious iced treats. Vasilis gentleness and bright smiles warm my heart. It is an unfamiliar feeling. I have always shied away from romantic advances, far too much to do to waste time entertaining such frivolities. But Vasili, I admit, has opened my eyes to the possibility.

        29th morning of Hammer<br /><br />

        The Sunseekers returned yesterday morning! I am so relieved that they are alive and well. I spend much of my morning listening to their harrowing tale. They ended up in Ravenloft of all places. I find it difficult to believe that they encountered Strahd and he allowed them to leave in one piece! Elizana came back with a renewed determination it seems. She was able to set up a dinner with the Lady Wachter. I am so grateful that Vasili agreed to join us. The dinner last night went exceedingly well. It feels invigorating to be involved in plans that could alter the course of history. I feel like I am making the difference my father would want me to make. Vasili is more serious than I first expected. He was so charming and I was mesmerized watching him converse with Lady Wachter with such ease and elegance. I felt my breast swell with pride that I am at his side and have fully accepted our courtship. By his side, I feel he will take me to heights I never imagined I could reach. The future looks very bright for us. I feel safe within the walls of Vallaki for the first time. It is so wonderful to not have to look over my shoulder and fear every shadow. Vasili is a bright light in my life that banishes any fear or doubt I have in my mind. His warm embrace is where I want to remain.

        4th Morning of Alturiak<br /><br />

        I was a fool to believe Vallaki would be a safe haven for me and I have in fact brought Strahd’s terrors with me all the way from the Village of Barovia. My presence alone has destroyed the homes of countless innocents- people have died, others are hurt and have lost loved ones because of me. I should have known better than to come to this place. I should have known that I would shatter the fragile peace these people have grown accustomed to. I foolishly, selfishly left my home behind thinking that I could somehow escape him. All this time he was by my side. Vasili was Strahd all along. How could I have loved him? How could I have let that monster into my heart? I was so blind. Now I must face reality, my presence is a curse to others, a death sentence. I can no longer be the catalyst for this evil. I can no longer infect the lives of innocents like a plague. To think that I sought the comfort of his embrace withers my very soul. Did I really love Strahd Von Zarovich? Or is this his sick way of playing with his pets? I am glad that my father cannot see how far I've fallen.
